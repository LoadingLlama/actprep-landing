                This introduction will help you understand what's on the ACT Reading Test and what you'll learn throughout this course.
            </div>

            <h3>What is on the ACT Reading Test?</h3>
            <p>The ACT Reading Test consists of 36 questions, which you have 40 minutes to complete with normal time and 60 minutes to complete with extended time. The Reading Test is broken down into four long passages with 9 questions each.</p>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Enhanced ACT Format (Current)</h4>
                <p>The 4 passages and the order you will see them on the ACT are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Literary Narrative</strong> – a passage adapted from a short story, novella, or novel.</li>
                    <li><strong>Informational</strong> – a passage that provides information on a topic related to social science, humanities, or natural science.</li>
                    <li><strong>Informational</strong> – a passage that provides information on a topic related to social science, humanities, or natural science.</li>
                    <li><strong>Informational</strong> – a passage that provides information on a topic related to social science, humanities, or natural science.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>Old ACT Format Reference</h4>
                <p>On the old version of the ACT, the passages appeared in this order:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Literary Narrative</li>
                    <li>Social Science</li>
                    <li>Humanities</li>
                    <li>Natural Science</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Based on practice ACTs released in 2025, we expect the passages will still follow this traditional order.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Dual Text Passages</h3>
            <p>1 of the 4 passages will be a dual text passage and will have two texts labelled as Passage A and Passage B. The dual text passage can be any of the 4 passages above.</p>
            
            <p>Although the passages are on different topics, they are all testing the same reading comprehension skills and can all be approached the same way. No passage type is inherently more difficult, but certain passages may be more difficult for you based on the types of passages that you find easier (or more interesting) to read.</p>

            <h3>What Will You Learn in This Course?</h3>
            <p>In this course, we will teach you how to understand the Reading Test at a much higher level. Right now, you are probably reading the passages, looking at the answer choices, and trying to pick which one seems correct to you without too much other knowledge. That approach only gets you so far and very much depends on your level of reading.</p>

        title: 'Chapter 1: 7 Core Principles for ACT Reading',

            <div class="lesson-intro">
                Before we start learning all the best approaches, strategies, and test-taking tips to maximize your Reading score, let's start by understanding 7 core principles about the ACT Reading Test.
            </div>

            <p>These principles will help you start to understand how the Reading Test works. Keep these core principles in mind as you work through the rest of the course!</p>

            <p>Students who struggle on the Reading Test generally do so for 2 reasons: <strong>issues with time management</strong> and <strong>difficulty understanding the key difference between correct and incorrect answer choices</strong>. We will focus more on time management later in this course. For now, the following 7 core principles will help you start to better understand the difference between correct and incorrect answer choices.</p>

            <h3>7 Core Principles to Understand</h3>

            <div class="rules-box">
                <h4>Principle #1 – The correct answer must be supported by evidence in the passage.</h4>
                <p>For an answer choice to be correct, we must be able to point to evidence in the passage. The ACT must be able to support the correct answer and say, "look, here is why this answer choice is correct," so there is ALWAYS evidence in the passage. In general, once you find the correct evidence in the passage, the correct answer choice will become obvious.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="rules-box">
                <h4>Principle #2 – The correct answer must be 100% correct. That means every single word in the answer choice must be correct.</h4>
                <p>As you read the answer choices, read every single word carefully and make sure that each word is correct. The correct answer must be 100% correct. Keep an eye out for strong or specific statements in each answer choice that may not be supported by the passage and can make the answer choice incorrect.</p>
                <p>For example, if an answer choice says, "sea turtles eat a diet consisting mostly of fish during migration," you need to make sure the passage actually says that sea turtles eat mostly fish during migration. If the passage says, "sea turtles eat fish, crabs, and seagrass during their annual migration," that is not 100% correct because including fish is not eating mostly fish.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="rules-box">
                <h4>Principle #3 – A single word can make the entire answer choice incorrect.</h4>
                <p>This is really important, so we will repeat it. <strong>A single word can make the entire answer choice incorrect!</strong> Anything wrong with an answer choice makes the entire answer choice incorrect. Even if 90% of an answer choice matches exactly what the passage says, an incorrect word makes the entire answer choice incorrect. Be very picky and consider every single word as you assess each answer choice.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="rules-box">
                <h4>Principle #4 – Do not just match words from the passage. Match the entire answer choice.</h4>
                <p>Many students make the mistake of picking an incorrect answer choice because it has an exact word or phrase from the passage. Sometimes the answer choice with the exact word or phrase from the passage matches the evidence and is correct. However, other times the answer choice is incorrect because it does not 100% match the passage. The ACT often includes incorrect answer choices that have exact word(s) from the passage to trick you.</p>
                <p>Make sure that you do not get too excited when you find an exact word or phrase from the passage in the answer choices. Instead, use Principles #2 and #3 and match the entire answer choice to the evidence in the passage.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="rules-box">
                <h4>Principle #5 – Find Your Waldo (over and over again)!</h4>
                <p>If you find the right evidence in the passage, the correct answer should be obvious. The challenge is finding the right evidence – and finding it quickly! If you have ever done a "Where's Waldo" book, you know exactly what I mean. You know Waldo is in there, but sometimes he is so hard to find! ACT Reading is the exact same; the evidence is in there, but sometimes it is hard to find. Once you find the evidence, you will know which answer choice is correct!</p>
                <p>For most students who answer a question on a Reading passage incorrectly, if I tell them what line(s) to look at, they will likely be able to look at the answer choices and go, "Oh, I see it now. The answer is A."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="rules-box">
                <h4>Principle #6 – No storytelling!</h4>
                <p>If you are telling a story to convince yourself why an answer choice is correct or could be correct, the answer is probably wrong. There is always evidence in the passage to support the correct answer, so you should never have to go through a long justification of why an answer choice is correct.</p>
                <p>Instead, put your finger on the right answer (Find Your Waldo!). As we said earlier, there is always evidence in the passage, so you should always aim to point to a specific part of the passage and say, "this is why my answer is correct."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="rules-box">
                <h4>Principle #7 – The ACT Reading Test is more about speed than comprehension.</h4>
                <p>If you have an extra 5 minutes for the Reading Test, it would be so much easier! The hardest thing about the ACT Reading for most students is time management. Finishing 4 long passages with 9 questions each in only 40 minutes is challenging. Most students do not find the passages themselves that difficult. Instead, the challenge is that you do not have enough time to answer all the questions.</p>
                <p>As you work through this course, keep this principle in mind. Do not feel the need to read for depth, as the questions are likely not going to require deep knowledge of the passage. Instead, the questions will require you to remember specific details from throughout the passage. As a result, you can read ACT Reading passages a bit faster than you might normally read other texts where you need a deeper understanding of what you are reading.</p>

            <div class="lesson-intro">
                Now that you have started to better understand the difference between correct and incorrect answer choices, let's introduce 3 important strategies to use to find the correct answer as consistently and efficiently as possible.
            </div>

            <p>You should always use these 3 strategies on the ACT Reading Test.</p>

            <h3>3 Strategies for Finding the Correct Answer</h3>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Strategy #1 – Put Your Finger on The Evidence</h4>
                <p>There is always evidence for the correct answer in the passage. As we said in Chapter 1, the ACT Reading is like "Where's Waldo" book…the challenge is just finding the Waldo quickly enough. If you can put your finger on the evidence that matches the answer choice, you will know that you found the correct answer.</p>
                <p><strong>And if you can put your finger on the evidence for every single question, you will get a fantastic ACT Reading score!</strong></p>
                <p>Now, finding the Waldo for every single question can be difficult and time consuming, so do not rely only on this strategy. Sometimes, you just cannot find that evidence and will need to move on. This is an important time management strategy that we will discuss more later in this course.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Strategy #2 – Read Like a Lawyer</h4>
                <p>When reading the question and the answer choices, read and consider every single word carefully. As you read the question, make sure you read the question carefully and know exactly what the question is asking you. As you read the answer choices, read critically and look for any specific details that could make the answer choice incorrect.</p>
                <p>Remember, the correct answer must be 100% correct; reading like a lawyer is important to make sure you do not pick an answer choice that may seem correct but is not 100% correct.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Strategy #3 – Eliminate Incorrect Answer Choices</h4>
                <p>The instant that you spot anything wrong with an answer choice, cross off the answer choice and never read it again. And yes, we do mean physically cross it off! Eliminating incorrect answer choices helps you save time, as you will not waste time re-reading answer choices you already decided were incorrect.</p>
                <p>In addition, if you are not confident on your answer and return to the question later, you will know which answer choice(s) you have already eliminated.</p>

            <div class="lesson-intro">
                Let's discuss the most common approaches to the Reading Test that we recommend for our students. Keep in mind that there is no single best approach to the ACT Reading, but there is a best approach for you.
            </div>

            <p>The right approach depends on your reading speed, your reading level, and a variety of other factors, all of which we will discuss in this chapter.</p>

            <p>The best way to find your favorite method is trial and error. Try different methods on practice ACTs and see which one you find the most effective. Once you find your preferred method, use that same method over and over on practice ACTs so you feel confident in your approach for test day.</p>

            <h3>Our 6 Approaches for ACT Reading Passages</h3>
            <p>We have 6 different approaches that we recommend for our students:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The Big Read</li>
                <li>The Big Read with Notes</li>
                <li>Label Then Read</li>
                <li>The Speed Reader</li>
                <li>First and Last</li>
                <li>Working Backwards</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Approach #1 – The Big Read</h4>
                <p><strong>Method:</strong> Read the entire passage at once and then work through the questions.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Read the entire passage including the short intro above the passage</li>
                    <li>Read to understand the passage; do not skim the passage</li>
                    <li>Read the passage in 2-4 minutes (3-6 minutes for extended time) at a medium pace</li>
                    <li>Be an active reader. At minimum, move your finger or pencil along as you read</li>
                    <li>After you complete the big read, work through the questions</li>
                    <li>Skip any broad passage questions and save them for last</li>
                    <li>Go back to the passage to find the evidence that supports the correct answer to each question</li>
                    <li>Follow the 30-second Rule. If you cannot find the evidence to answer the question in 30 seconds, bubble in your best guess, circle the question number, and move on</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Who it's good for:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stronger readers who can stay focused for the entire long passage</li>
                    <li>Faster readers who can read the entire passage and remember details from throughout the passage</li>
                    <li>Students who find it more difficult to understand the passage when they do not read the entire passage at once</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Who it's bad for:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Slower readers who cannot finish the passage in time with this method</li>
                    <li>Weaker readers who cannot stay focused for the entire long passage</li>
                    <li>Students who do not remember the entire passage if they read the whole passage in one read</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Approach #2 – The Big Read with Notes</h4>
                <p><strong>Method:</strong> Identical to the Big Read except that you write down a quick note after every 10-15 lines or after each paragraph that summarizes what is being discussed.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Read the entire passage including the short intro above the passage</li>
                    <li>Write down a note after every 10-15 lines or after each paragraph</li>
                    <li>The note can be a single word or a short phrase</li>
                    <li>Having to write down a note forces you to stay focused on the passage and helps you more quickly find the correct part of the passage when answering the questions</li>
                    <li>After you read the entire passage, work through the questions</li>
                    <li>Use your notes to find the evidence in the passage that supports the correct answer for each question</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Who it's good for:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Students who like to read the whole passage but have trouble staying focused</li>
                    <li>Students who do not remember what happens in which parts of the passage without taking notes</li>
                    <li>Students who find the notes helpful when answering the questions</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Who it's bad for:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Students who do not need the notes to remember what happens where in the passage</li>
                    <li>Students who find that writing notes makes them read the passage less effectively</li>
                    <li>Slower readers who cannot finish the passage in time with this method</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Approach #3 – Label Then Read</h4>
                <p><strong>Method:</strong> Look at the questions first for any that reference a specific line or paragraph and label where those questions are in the passage.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Skim the questions and look for line references in the questions or specific references to a paragraph</li>
                    <li>Label where the lines for questions are in the passage with the question number</li>
                    <li>Read the passage</li>
                    <li>As you get to lines that are labelled, either read the context carefully and then answer the question, or read the question first and then read the lines carefully</li>
                    <li>Continue to read the passage, repeating this process for any other labelled lines</li>
                    <li>After you have read the entire passage, answer questions that you have not answered yet</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="tip-box">
                    <h4>The 2-Sentence Rule</h4>
                    <p>For any question with a line reference or when you find the appropriate keywords, read 2 sentences before and 2 sentences after. The evidence is most commonly in the 2 sentences before or after the line reference or the keywords.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p><strong>Who it's good for:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Students who have issues with time management</li>
                    <li>Students who find reading the entire passage without any breaks difficult</li>
                    <li>Students who have trouble focusing on the passage</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Who it's bad for:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Strong readers who read quickly and can retain all the important details in the passage in one big read</li>
                    <li>Students who find that stopping during reading to answer questions makes it more difficult for them to understand the passage</li>

                <h4>Approach #4 – The Speed Reader</h4>
                <p><strong>Method:</strong> Read the first few sentences of a paragraph until you get an idea of what the paragraph is about, write down a quick note, and then skip ahead to the start of the next paragraph.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Read the first sentence(s) of the paragraph. Read only enough to get an idea of what topic(s) the paragraph is about</li>
                    <li>Write a note next to the paragraph</li>
                    <li>Go to the start of the next paragraph and repeat the process</li>

            <h3>How to Approach Dual Text Passages</h3>
            <p>Each ACT Reading Test will have 1 dual text passage with two shorter passages labelled as Passage A and Passage B. When working on a dual text passage, we recommend that you read each passage separately:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Read Passage A and answer questions for Passage A</li>
                <li>Read Passage B and answer questions for Passage B</li>
                <li>Answer questions about both passages</li>
            </ol>

            <p>If you use Working Backwards, then use the following approach:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Answer questions for Passage A</li>
                <li>Answer questions for Passage B</li>
                <li>Answer questions about both passages</li>
            </ol>

            </div>

            <h3>Pacing</h3>
            <p>The ACT Reading Test is composed of 4 passages you must complete in 40 minutes (60 minutes for extended time). On average, you have 10 minutes per passage. For extended time, you get 15 minutes per passage.</p>

            <p>Memorize the pace and the breakdowns above to help you keep pace on test day. These timing breakdowns are general estimates and should not be treated strictly. You are not going to complete every passage in the same amount of time.</p>

            <p>At the end of each passage, check your watch. If you are on pace or ahead of pace, keep working as you have been. If you are behind pace, take note of that and pick up the pace.</p>

            <h3>10 Time Management Skills</h3>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>1) Know Your Order</h4>
                <p>You do not need to complete the passages in the order that they are presented on the ACT. We recommend completing your favorite passage(s) first and saving your least favorite passage for last.</p>
                <p>As you complete practice ACTs, keep in mind what passage(s) you like and what passage(s) you find more challenging. Even if the passages are not in order, you should be able to identify the type of passage based on the quick description at the very top of each passage.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>2) Skip Broad Passage Questions</h4>
                <p>The first question (and sometimes the first 2 questions) in the passage often asks about the passage as a whole. You should always skip broad passage question(s) and answer them last. After answering the rest of the questions in the passage, you will understand the passage better, and, therefore, will be more likely to answer the broad passage questions correctly.</p>
                <p>This is also a time-saving tip because you can answer these questions more quickly after answering all other questions in the passage.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>3) Get to Know the Pace</h4>
                <p>Knowing how much time you have per passage is not good enough. It is important to really get to know the pace, so you can tell when you are on pace, ahead of pace, or behind pace without having to constantly check your watch.</p>
                <p>Once you know the pace, you will have an internal voice in your head tell you when you have more time on a question or when you need to move on. The only way to accomplish this is practice, practice, practice!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>4) Follow The 30-Second Rule. Do Not Get Stuck</h4>
                <p>One of the most common mistakes students make is getting stuck on a question for too long. If you get stuck on a question for more than 30 seconds, bubble in your best guess and move on.</p>
                <p>It is far better to take your best guess on any question(s) that give you trouble and finish the Reading Test than it is to run out of time and completely guess on a bunch of questions as time is running out.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>5) Circle Guesses, Box Non-Confident Answers</h4>
                <p>What should you do if you cannot find the Waldo and need to move on? If you completely guess on a question, <strong>circle the question number</strong>. If you answer a question but are not confident in your answer, <strong>box the number</strong>.</p>
                <p>If you finish the Reading Test with time left, go back to any questions where you circled the number. After answering those questions, if you still have time left, go back to any questions where you boxed the number.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>6) Answer Questions Out of Order</h4>
                <p>You do not need to answer the questions in the order that they are presented on the test. In fact, you probably should not always answer the questions in order! Instead, be open to answering the questions out of order.</p>
                <p>For some students, it is best to start with questions with line references and other questions that you can find quickly. If you cannot find the right part of the passage quickly for a question, skip the question and come back to it. As you go back to the passage for other questions, you may come across the evidence in the passage that you could not find and can go back and answer the question you skipped.</p>
                <p>Remember, the questions on the ACT Reading are not strictly chronological, so the questions are not in the order of where the evidence appears in the passage.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>7) Know Where Waldo Is More Likely Going to Be Based on the Question Number</h4>
                <p>The 9 questions in each passage are not chronological, but there is a rough pattern that might help you find the evidence more quickly:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Questions 1-3:</strong> Start of the passage, most likely in the first third of the passage. (*Note: This does not count broad passage questions.)</li>
                    <li><strong>Questions 4-7:</strong> Could be anywhere but start looking somewhere in the middle of the passage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Questions 8-9:</strong> End of the passage, most likely in the last 2 paragraphs.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These are rough guidelines and absolutely NOT RULES! These are just the locations where the Waldo is most likely going to be.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>8) Wear a Watch and Check Your Watch After Each Passage</h4>
                <p>Wear a watch on test day. You cannot bring a smart watch, and your watch cannot make noise.</p>
                <p>Check your watch at the end of each passage. A quick watch check along with memorizing the timing breakdown tells you if you are ahead of pace, right on pace, or behind pace. You can then adjust accordingly to make sure you finish all 4 passages.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>9) Do Not Freak Out If You Fall Behind the Pace</h4>
                <p>This is a very important one! If you check your watch and see that you are behind the pace, do not freak out! In this situation, most students panic, start to rush, read the next passage as quickly as possible, and answer questions too quickly, which usually leads to a bunch of incorrect answers.</p>
                <p>When you notice that you are behind the pace, make minor adjustments to your approach. Try to read a little bit more quickly but do not read so fast that you cannot understand what you are reading. More importantly, make quicker decisions when answering the questions.</p>
                <p>Some 50-75% sure answers and finishing all the questions is still better than having to guess on a bunch of questions at the end.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>10) Know When to Go with Your Gut</h4>
                <p>You should (1) know how confident you need to be to accurately pick the correct answer and (2) know if you can answer the question from memory or if you need to go back to the passage.</p>
                <p>Students who have strong recall can rely on their memory to know what is right vs. wrong. If you know the answer right away, bubble it in and move on without going back to the passage. If you think you know the answer but are not 100% confident, go back to the passage and double-check to make sure you get the answer correct.</p>
                <p>Knowing when to trust your gut versus when you need to go back to the passage is a very powerful skill to help manage your time correctly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>Common Test Day Mistake To Avoid</h4>
                <p>Many students stop trusting their gut on test day and start finding the "Waldo" every time. If you do this, you will suddenly have timing issues on the real ACT when you are normally finishing the Reading Test on your practice tests.</p>
                <p>With practice, you will know when to go with your gut and answer a question right away, when to go back to the passage and look for the evidence, and when to skip the question and answer it later.</p>

            </div>

            <p>ACT Reading questions can be broken into 7 types of questions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Broad Passage</li>
                <li>Clear Evidence</li>

                <li>Purpose</li>
                <li>Main Idea</li>
                <li>Words in Context</li>
                <li>Comparing Passages</li>
            </ol>

            <p>These categories cover 95+% of questions on the ACT, but there can still be some other miscellaneous question types.</p>

            <h3>1) Broad Passage Questions</h3>
            <div class="concept-box">
                <p>Broad passage questions are often the first question (and sometimes the first 2 questions) in a passage. Some common broad passage questions are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The passage can be best described as</li>
                    <li>The main idea of the passage is</li>
                    <li>The main purpose of the passage is to</li>
                    <li>The author's central claim is</li>
                    <li>The passage is written from the point of view of</li>
                    <li>A central theme of the passage is</li>
                    <li>Which choice best describes the narrator?</li>
                    <li>Which choice best describes the overall structure of the passage?</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Remember, we recommend skipping broad passage questions and answering them last.</strong> After completing the rest of the questions, you will understand the passage better and are more likely to answer broad passage questions correctly.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>2) Clear Evidence Questions</h3>
            <div class="concept-box">
                <p>For clear evidence questions, the correct answer is a restatement or rephrasing of evidence directly stated in the passage. Once you find your Waldo, the correct answer will most commonly be "slap-you-in-the-face" obvious.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Clear evidence questions almost always have at least one of the following keywords:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Indicates</li>
                    <li>States</li>
                    <li>Argues</li>
                    <li>Describes</li>
                    <li>Claims</li>
                    <li>According to the passage(s)/author/narrator</li>
                    <li>Based on the passage(s)</li>
                    <li>In the passage(s)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Other less common clear evidence keywords:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Characterizes</li>
                    <li>Clarifies</li>
                    <li>As presented in the passage(s)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> Whenever we spot a clear evidence question, we know that we are looking for clear evidence in the passage. Do not make any inferences when answering the question! This is one of the most common mistakes that students make.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>3) Inference Questions</h3>
            <div class="concept-box">
                <p>For inference questions, the correct answer is most commonly not directly stated in the passage. Instead, the correct answer is demonstrated in the passage. There is still strong evidence from the passage to support the correct answer, but the evidence is not going to directly match the answer choice.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Inference questions always have at least one of the following keywords:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Inferred</li>
                    <li>Implies</li>
                    <li>Suggests</li>
                    <li>Assumed</li>
                    <li>Most reasonably</li>
                    <li>Most likely</li>
                    <li>Most clearly</li>
                    <li>Most nearly</li>
                    <li>Most strongly</li>
                    <li>Best supports</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="example-box">
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> His mother, standing across the room, smiled warmly at Elijah. His grandfather, a man known for his short temper and intimidating appearance, knelt and reached out his hand.</p>
                    <p><strong>Question:</strong> In the passage, the actions of Elijah's mother suggest that she</p>
                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A. wishes to support Elijah's interaction with his grandfather.</p>
                    <p>Notice that the passage never directly states that Elijah's mother supports the interaction with the grandfather, but the "smiling warmly" at this interaction demonstrates her support.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>Inference questions are generally more difficult because you must select an answer choice that is demonstrated but not directly stated in the passage. Remember that there still needs to be evidence (and usually strong evidence) from the passage to support the correct answer.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>4) Purpose Questions</h3>
            <div class="concept-box">
                <p>Purpose questions ask us to think about WHY a sentence, quotation, or paragraph is included in the passage.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Purpose questions always have at least one of the following keywords:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Purpose</li>
                    <li>Serve(s) to</li>
                    <li>In order to</li>
                    <li>Mainly to</li>
                    <li>Function</li>
                    <li>Primarily to</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>To answer purpose questions correctly, we must read for context and think about WHY the information is included in the passage. If you read just the lines or the paragraph in the question, you will likely not have the context that you need to answer the question correctly.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>5) Main Idea Questions</h3>
            <div class="concept-box">
                <p>Main idea questions ask us to figure out WHAT a portion of the passage or paragraph is saying. The correct answer to a main idea question summarizes the part of the passage the question is asking about.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Main idea questions most commonly have the following keywords:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Main idea</li>
                    <li>Best summarizes</li>
                    <li>Central claim</li>
                    <li>Paraphrases</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>For main idea questions, focus on the part of the passage the question is asking you to consider and summarize what is being said. You should still read for a little bit of context, but the context for main idea questions is not as important.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>6) Words in Context Questions</h3>
            <div class="concept-box">
                <p>Words in context questions ask us to select what a word or phrase most nearly means in the context of the passage. Usually, we are being asked about the meaning of a word or phrase that is being used in an uncommon way in the passage.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Words in context questions always have the phrase "most nearly means" and look like this:</strong></p>
                <p>As used in line 61, "audible" most nearly means</p>
                <p>A. Noisy<br>B. Detectable<br>C. Noticeable<br>D. Clear</p>
                
                <p>To find the correct answer, you must read for context. We recommend that you read the sentence before, the sentence the word or phrase is included in, and the following sentence.</p>
                
                <div class="tip-box">
                    <h4>Two Approaches for Words in Context Questions</h4>
                    <p><strong>Method #1: Pick Your Own Word</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Read for context</li>
                        <li>Pick your own word to replace the word</li>
                        <li>Look at the answer choices and pick the word that best matches your word</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p><strong>Method #2: Plug the Answer Choices Back into the Passage</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Read each answer choice back in the passage. Make sure to read for context</li>
                        <li>Pick the answer choice that best replaces the word</li>
                    </ol>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <h4>Do Not Assume the Hard Vocabulary Word is Correct</h4>
                    <p>If you see any word(s) that you do not know in a words in context question, do not assume the hard word is correct. Sometimes, the ACT is testing your vocabulary and the hard word is correct. Other times, the hard word is just a decoy and a simpler word that you know fits correctly.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>7) Comparing Passages Questions</h3>
            <div class="concept-box">
                <p>At the end of the dual text passage, there are 3 comparing passages questions. These questions ask us to compare the dual text passages in a variety of ways, including many of the question types we have covered already in this chapter.</p>
                
                <p>These questions are easy to spot because the question will clearly indicate that you are using both passages by referencing the passages or the authors of the passages.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Comparing passages questions can look like this:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Which choice best describes the relationship between the two passages?</li>
                    <li>One similarity between passage A and passage B is that both passages argue</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>In general, you should approach comparing passages questions with the same methods that we will learn for the questions in a normal passage.</p>

        title: 'Chapter 6: Breaking Down Questions – How to Identify Exactly What the ACT is Asking You',
        content: `
            <div class="lesson-intro">
                The most important skill for success on the Reading Test is effectively breaking down each question to identify exactly what the ACT is asking you. Many students believe that they are already doing this, but most are not doing it effectively enough or at all.
            </div>

            <p>Let us give you an example to better explain what we mean. Imagine that you are taking an ACT Reading Test and are working on a question. You read the question and go back to the passage to look for the evidence. All of a sudden, I reach across the table and take your ACT away and ask you, "what exactly are you looking for?" If you cannot tell me EXACTLY what you are looking for, you are not doing a good enough job breaking down the question.</p>

            <p>In this chapter, we will teach you the skills and methods that you need to effectively break down questions and identify exactly what you are looking for when you go to the passage. The better you get at breaking down questions, the easier the Reading Test becomes.</p>

            <h3>Skill #1 – Identify the Type of Question</h3>
            <div class="concept-box">
                <p>When you read a question, you first need to identify the type of question. You should memorize all the key words and approaches we learned in Chapter 5 to make identifying question types easy. Knowing what type of question you are looking at is critical to knowing how to approach the question and the type of evidence to look for in the passage.</p>
                
                <div class="practice-box">
                    <h4>Practice Examples:</h4>
                    <p><strong>1.</strong> The passage indicates that Austin had what reaction when Mr. Amar told him his cabinet was not up to industry standards?</p>
                    <p><em>Question Type: Clear Evidence</em></p>
                    
                    <p><strong>2.</strong> It can be inferred that the first attempt to fix the water contamination issue failed because it:</p>
                    <p><em>Question Type: Inference</em></p>
                    
                    <p><strong>3.</strong> The author discusses dual insulation in water bottles in order to:</p>
                    <p><em>Question Type: Purpose</em></p>
                    
                    <p><strong>4.</strong> According to the passage, Terry would occasionally appear at the tennis courts to:</p>
                    <p><em>Question Type: Clear Evidence</em></p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Skill #2 – Identify the Keywords</h3>
            <div class="concept-box">
                <p>To find the evidence in the passage quickly, we want to identify the keyword(s) in the question. The keyword(s) are the words or phrases that we can skim for in the passage. On the ACT, the keyword(s) from the question are almost always right nearby the evidence.</p>
                
                <p>If you can find the keyword(s) in the passage, the evidence is almost always right nearby. The keywords are like little flags saying, "Look over here for the evidence!" After you find the keyword(s), use the 2-sentence rule – read the 2 sentences before and 2 sentences after.</p>
                
                <div class="example-box">
                    <h4>Example 1:</h4>
                    <p>In the passage, the narrator describes a brick wall of an abandoned restaurant as:</p>
                    <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> "brick wall" and "abandoned restaurant"</p>
                    <p>If you can find where the passage discusses the brick wall of the abandoned restaurant, the Waldo should be right nearby and clearly match one of the answer choices.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="example-box">
                    <h4>Example 2:</h4>
                    <p>The passage suggests that one difference between a white dwarf and a red giant is that a red giant:</p>
                    <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> "white dwarf" and "red giant"</p>
                    <p>We need to look for "white dwarf" and "red giant" in the passage and then look for a difference.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Primary and Secondary Keywords</h3>
            <div class="concept-box">
                <p>After we identify the keywords, we want to identify the primary and secondary keywords. The primary keywords are the one(s) that are (1) easiest to locate in the passage and (2) more unique to the question.</p>
                
                <p>Once you see the primary keyword(s) in the passage, finding the secondary keyword(s) will confirm that you are in the right area.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Steps to use keywords effectively:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Underline the keyword(s) as you read the question</li>
                    <li>Identify the primary keyword(s)</li>
                    <li>Look for the primary keyword(s) in the passage</li>
                    <li>Once you find the primary keyword(s), use the 2-sentence rule</li>
                    <li>Find the evidence in the passage (the Waldo) and answer the question</li>
                </ol>
                
                <div class="example-box">
                    <h4>Example: Primary vs. Secondary Keywords</h4>
                    <p>The passage indicates that covering themselves in mud might benefit some mammals by:</p>
                    <p><strong>Primary Keywords:</strong> covering themselves in mud</p>
                    <p><strong>Secondary Keywords:</strong> benefit, mammals</p>
                    <p>The primary keywords "covering themselves in mud" are most likely only discussed once in the passage and will be easier to locate. The secondary keywords "benefit" and "mammals" are likely going to appear more commonly throughout the passage.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Primary Keywords - 3 Common Types</h3>
            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>1) Capitalized Words (Names, locations, etc.)</h4>
                <p>Names, locations, or any other capitalized words are always good keywords to prioritize, especially when answering a question without a line reference. Capitalized words are easier to find when skimming through the passage.</p>
                
                <h4>2) Numbers</h4>
                <p>Numbers are always a primary keyword. Just like capitalized words, numbers are always easy to find in the passage, making them great keywords for any question without a line reference.</p>
                
                <h4>3) Unique Keywords</h4>
                <p>Look for unique keyword(s) in the question that are not consistently used in the passage. Once you find the unique keyword(s) in the passage, read for context. The evidence is usually within a few sentences of the unique keyword(s).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>Look for Synonyms of Keywords</h4>
                <p>The exact keywords from the question are not always in the passage, so you should also look for synonyms of the primary and secondary keywords. For most questions, the exact keywords from the question will be in the passage, but that is not always the case.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a question asks about the narrator's relationship with her family, you cannot just look for the word "family." Any of these synonyms also refer to the narrator's family: mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter, siblings, cousin, etc.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Skill #3 – Rephrase the Question in Your Own Words (If Necessary)</h3>
            <div class="concept-box">
                <p>For many questions on the ACT, the keyword(s) are enough to know exactly what you are looking for. For these questions, there is no need to rephrase the question in your own words.</p>
                
                <p>For more complicated questions that are a bit more challenging to break down, it can be important to rephrase the questions in your own words. If you can rephrase the question in your own words, you know exactly what you are looking for when you go back to the passage.</p>
                
                <div class="example-box">
                    <h4>Example of When to Rephrase:</h4>
                    <p><strong>Question:</strong> The narrator indicates that which of the following potential risks that doctors face while at work is a concern to her father?</p>
                    <p><strong>Rephrase:</strong> What risk that doctors face is a concern for her father?</p>
                    <p>With this question, there is not a clear primary keyword(s) that we can easily skim for in the passage. The best primary keyword here is probably "father." However, if you just go skim for "father" in the passage and are not clear that you are looking for "risks that doctors face that concern her father," you are likely going to have much more trouble finding the right part of the passage.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>Tips For When to Rephrase the Question</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>If you read a question and are unclear exactly what the question is asking, rephrase the question in your own words before going back to the passage</li>
                    <li>For long questions with many keywords, rephrase the question</li>
                    <li>Generally speaking, the longer the question is, the more likely you should rephrase the question in your own words</li>
                    <li>Find what works for you! There is no set of rules for when to rephrase the question vs. when to use the keywords</li>

        title: 'Chapter 7: How to Approach the Answer Choices',
        content: `
            <div class="lesson-intro">
                After identifying the question type, finding the primary and secondary keywords, and rephrasing the question (if necessary), we are ready to go back to the passage, find the Waldo, and answer the question. Part of that process involves reading the answer choices.
            </div>

            <p>After we break down the question, we will use the following steps to answer a question:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Go to the passage and skim for the primary keyword(s)</li>
                <li>Find the keyword(s) in the passage and use the 2-sentence rule. Look for secondary keyword(s)</li>
                <li>Find your Waldo</li>
                <li>Read the answer choices</li>
                <li>Eliminate incorrect answer choices</li>
                <li>Find the correct answer choice that is supported by evidence from the passage</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Note:</strong> The steps above are not numbered! There is no exact order to go through the steps. The order that you will go through these steps will depend on the question type, how easily you can find the correct part of the passage, and your own personal preference.</p>

            <h3>When to Read the Answer Choices</h3>
            <p>After reading the question, should I read the answer choices right away or go back to the passage first? The answer is it depends on the question type, your reading comprehension skills, and your recall of the passage.</p>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>1. For "which of the following" questions, read the answer choices right away.</h4>
                <p>Without reading the answer choices, it is impossible to know what you are looking for to answer the question.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Which of the following statements best describes the author's view of Grier's theory on internet marketing?</p>
                <p>For any "which of the following" questions, read the answer choices before going back to the passage. Knowing the 4 options before you read the passage makes it easier to find the correct answer or eliminate incorrect answer choices.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>2. For purpose questions, read the passage first and come up with YOUR answer.</h4>
                <p>For purpose questions, we recommend going back to the passage, reading for context, and coming up with your own answer. Once you have your answer, look at the answer choices to see which one best matches your reasoning.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>3. For broad passage questions, try to come up with YOUR own answer first.</h4>
                <p>After reading the entire passage and answering all other questions, you will likely understand the passage pretty well, so you can come up with your own answer when asked about the passage as a whole.</p>
                
                <p>If you found the passage difficult to understand and cannot come up with your own answer, read the answer choices right away. Knowing the 4 options can make it easier to go back to the passage and find the answer choice that matches or to eliminate answer choices that are incorrect.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>4. For clear evidence and inference questions, try both methods below and find what is better for you.</h4>
                
                <p><strong>Method #1 – Reading the answer choices right away.</strong></p>
                <p>This can be helpful because you know the 4 options that you are looking for in the passage before going back to the passage. As you read, you may come across the Waldo and recognize that it matches an answer choice you just read.</p>
                <p>This method does not work if reading the answer choices distracts you from knowing EXACTLY what the question is asking.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Method #2 – Go back to the passage first.</strong></p>
                <p>If reading the answer choices distracts you from what the question is asking, go back to the passage first, look for evidence, and then read the answer choices. Clear evidence and inference questions are usually quite specific, so you will likely know where in the passage you need to read.</p>
                
                <p>If you use method #2 and cannot find the evidence for a clear evidence or inference question in the first 20-30 seconds, read the answer choices. The answer choices may trigger your memory of something you read.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>5. Read the answer choices right away when you do not have primary keywords.</h4>
                <p>For any vague questions that do not have any primary keywords, read the answer choices right away. The answer choices may help you identify where in the passage to go or may trigger your memory from something that you have already read.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>6. Let the answer choices help on passages you have trouble understanding.</h4>
                <p>For any passage that you have trouble understanding, read the answer choices more quickly. If you read a passage and feel like you just do not know what is going on, let the answer choices help you.</p>
                
                <p>Let's say you are asked a question about the main idea of a paragraph. After reading the paragraph, you have no idea what the paragraph is saying. Read the 4 answer choices and then reread the paragraph. Now that you know the 4 options, you may be able to recognize what the main idea of the paragraph is.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>How to Read the Answer Choices Most Effectively</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Our Recommended Approach – Work Both Forwards and Backwards</h4>
                <p>We recommend working forwards (look for evidence in the passage) and backwards (eliminate incorrect answer choices) at the same time.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Work Forwards – Look for the Evidence in the Passage</strong></p>
                <p>Working forwards is looking for the evidence in the passage that matches the correct answer choice. When working forwards, put your finger on the evidence (the Waldo!) and match it to the correct answer choice.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Work Backwards – Eliminate Incorrect Answer Choices</strong></p>
                <p>Working backwards is eliminating incorrect answer choices. Anytime you see an answer choice that is incorrect for any reason, cross it off.</p>
                
                <p>For some questions, it is easier to eliminate three answer choices as incorrect than it is to find the evidence that supports the correct answer. Even if you cannot find evidence in the passage, if you can eliminate 3 answer choices as incorrect, you have found the correct answer.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>How to Work Forwards and Backwards</h4>
                <p>As you read each answer choice, you should be simultaneously working forward and backwards. Ask yourself the following questions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Is there evidence in the passage that matches what this answer choice says?</li>
                    <li>Is there any specific detail or strong statement in this answer choice that could make it incorrect?</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>The first question is working forwards. The second question is working backwards. As you read each answer choice, look for any word(s) that could make the answer choice incorrect. Be cautious about specific details or strong statements in the answer choices.</p>
                
                <p>In general, stronger and more specific answer choices are usually incorrect because they cannot be supported by the passage. Oppositely, more boring answer choices are more commonly correct.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>Important Tip</h4>
                <p>If you are stuck between two answer choices and cannot find any evidence to support either one, always pick the less detailed answer choice. Boring is usually better on the ACT Reading Test!</p>

            <div class="lesson-intro">
                One of the most important skills in the Reading Test is understanding what makes an answer choice correct or incorrect. Many students struggle with this when first taking the Reading Test and feel like they are being asked to somehow find what the ACT says is the "best" answer. This is not the case!
            </div>

            <p>There is always 1 correct and 3 incorrect answer choices. The challenge is knowing what makes the correct answer right and the incorrect answer wrong. You should NOT approach the Reading Test by looking for the best answer. Instead, we are looking for the 1 correct answer choice or why 3 answer choices are incorrect.</p>

            <p>In this chapter, we will teach you how to breakdown each answer choice to identify the difference between correct and incorrect answer choices.</p>

            <h3>The 5 Common Types of Incorrect Answer Choices</h3>
            <p>For success on the Reading Test, you must be able to explain what makes an answer choice incorrect. Remember, for an answer choice to be correct, it must be supported by evidence in passage and answer the question being asked.</p>

            <p>The 5 most common types of incorrect answers on the ACT Reading Test are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Not in the Passage</li>
                <li>Too Specific</li>
                <li>Too Broad</li>
                <li>Opposite or Slant of the Passage</li>
                <li>In the Passage but Not Answering the Question</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>1) Not in the Passage</h4>
                <p>Many incorrect answer choices include information that is not in the passage. If the answer choice includes details that are not in the passage, the answer is incorrect.</p>
                
                <div class="example-box">
                    <p><strong>Example Passage:</strong> Adam rolled up the tattered sleeves of his sweater, exposing the winding snake tattoos on both of his forearms. He had gotten them after he returned from his first tour in Iraq – an homage to his fallen comrades. Despite now living in upstate New York, he still wore his Army boots every day, the tops of which were hidden below his faded black jeans, the only pair that he owns because, as he says, "they're the only ones that fit me just right."</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Question:</strong> Based on the passage, which of the following can be assumed about Adam's clothing?</p>
                    <p>A. He only wears the most comfortable clothing that he can buy.<br>
                    B. The army provided him with free clothes after he returned home from Iraq.<br>
                    C. His clothes are old and worn out.<br>
                    D. He only owns one sweater.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> C. The "tattered sleeves" and "faded black jeans" both demonstrate that his clothing is old and worn out. All other answer choices are not supported by evidence from the passage.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>2) Too Specific</h4>
                <p>Incorrect answer choices are very commonly too specific. Often, a single word or a short phrase in an answer choice makes the entire answer choice incorrect. If the answer choice is too specific and goes beyond what the passage says, it is always incorrect.</p>
                
                <p>As you read each answer choice, look for specific details and strong statements that could make the answer choice incorrect. Ask yourself, "Does the passage really say that?" Remember, the more specific and stronger an answer choice is, the more likely it will be incorrect.</p>
                
                <div class="example-box">
                    <p><strong>Example Passage:</strong> Pelicans fish by using their long beaks and large throat pouches to scoop up prey from the water's surface. Pelicans' diets include fish, amphibians, small turtles, crabs, and even other small birds. Most pelicans use a technique called "dive-bombing," where the birds will tuck their wings and dive directly into the water at unsuspecting fish. However, pelicans have also been known to hunt cooperatively, especially when hunting near the shores. The groups of birds will form a line to drive schools of smaller fish into the shallower waters, beating their wings near the surface, and then scooping up their favorite prey.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Question:</strong> Which of the following statements can be inferred from the passage?</p>
                    <p>A. Pelicans prey predominantly on fish during the summer months.<br>
                    B. Great White pelicans are the only species of pelicans that hunt for turtles.<br>
                    C. Small ocean fish are the main prey for pelicans.<br>
                    D. Pelicans do the majority of their hunting in shallow waters near the coast.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> A, B, and D are incorrect because they are too specific. For A, the passage does say that fish are included in their diet, but it never specified anything about summer months. For B, the passage never discussed Great White pelicans. For D, the passage never details where pelicans do the majority of their hunting.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>3) Too Broad</h4>
                <p>Sometimes, an answer choice is incorrect because it is too broad. This occurs when the answer choice does not specifically answer the question being asked (more common) or does not match a more specific statement made in the passage (less common).</p>
                
                <p>While broad answer choices are better in general, make sure that the answer choice you pick is always specific enough to answer the exact question you are being asked.</p>
                
                <div class="example-box">
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a question asks about the main idea of a passage about Dr. Robert's research to test his new theory about evolution, an answer choice that says "research the theory of evolution using Darwin's finches" would be too broad. While the passage does discuss the theory of evolution, researching the theory of evolution is not the main idea of the passage.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>4) Opposite or Slant of the Passage</h4>
                <p>Many incorrect answers on the ACT are the opposite or a slant of what the passage states. These answer choices often look correct because they include exact words or phrases from the passage; however, they are incorrect because the answer choice is the opposite or a slant of what is in the passage.</p>
                
                <p>Remember, you should not pick an answer choice just because you find a word or phrase that is directly in the passage, as these are often incorrect answer choices. Always make sure the answer choice is 100% correct.</p>
                
                <div class="example-box">
                    <p><strong>Example Passage:</strong> Ice triggers the movement of ocean currents. As water freezes in the North and South Poles, the water surrounding the ice becomes saltier and colder since the salt leaves the water upon freezing. The newly formed ice then cools the surrounding water. The cold, salty water sinks due to its increased density. Once it gets to the bottom of the ocean floor, the water must move somewhere – so it travels southward to spread across the submerged surface of the earth. This is a cold current. Warm water replaces it on the surface and moves to the north. This motion is known by scientists as the global conveyor belt, a globe-wide current that circulates cold and warm water around the earth.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Question:</strong> Which of the following statements about the global conveyor belt is best supported by the passage?</p>
                    <p>A. Cold, salty water at the North and South Poles comes to the surface and replaces the water that turned into ice.<br>
                    B. The ocean currents that make up the global conveyor belt change with the seasons.<br>
                    C. Melting ice at the North and South Poles is the first step in the chain reaction that causes the ocean currents.<br>
                    D. Cold, salty water travels south on the ocean floor and warm water moves north on the surface.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> A is incorrect because it's opposite of the passage. A says that the cold, salty water comes to the surface, but the passage says the cold, salty water sinks. C is also opposite of the passage – the passage says that freezing water, not melting ice, is the first step in the process.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>5) In the Passage but Not Answering the Question</h4>
                <p>This final type of incorrect answer choice is often the most difficult to avoid. These are answer choices that are directly stated in the passage but do not answer the question being asked. You will be able to go to the passage, find the information, and match it with the answer choice. However, it will still be incorrect!</p>
                
                <p>This is a good spot to reiterate two important tips we have learned already:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Do not select an answer choice because it has a word or phrase that matches the passage. Make sure the answer choice is 100% correct. The ACT will often put exact words or phrases from the passage in incorrect answer choices to try to trick you.</li>
                    <li>Finding evidence for an answer choice in the passage does not mean you found the correct answer. You still need to make sure you are answering the question the ACT is asking.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="key-takeaway">
                <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>
                <p>Understanding these 5 types of incorrect answer choices will help you eliminate wrong answers more effectively and identify the correct answer with greater confidence. Remember: there is always exactly one correct answer that is 100% supported by the passage and directly answers the question being asked.</p>

        title: 'Chapter 9: Words in Context Questions',
        content: `
            <div class="lesson-intro">
                Words in context questions ask you to select what a word or phrase "most nearly means" in the context of the passage. Usually, you are asked to determine the meaning of a word or phrase that is being used in an unusual or uncommon way in the passage.
            </div>

            <p>Most often, the correct answer is not the actual definition of the word but instead an alternate meaning based on the context.</p>

            <p>Words in context questions always have the phrase "most nearly means" and look like this:</p>
            <div class="example-box">
                <p>As used in line 9, "critical" most nearly means</p>
                <p>A. grave<br>B. negative<br>C. urgent<br>D. important</p>
            </div>

            <p>To find the correct answer, read for context. We recommend that you read the sentence before, the sentence the word or phrase is in, and the following sentence. If you are still not clear on what the word or phrase means, read for more context – as much as you need to understand the context.</p>

            <h3>How to Approach Words in Context Questions</h3>
            <p>There are two approaches that are effective for these questions.</p>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Method #1: Pick Your Own Word</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Read for context. Read at least 1 sentence before and after the word or phrase in the question and more if necessary.</li>
                    <li>Pick your own word(s) to replace the word or phrase in the question. Write your word(s) down.</li>
                    <li>If you are having trouble picking a specific word, try to pick a tone. Decide if the tone of the word or phrase is positive, negative, or neutral based on the surrounding text.</li>
                    <li>Look at the answer choices and pick the one that best matches your word(s) or tone.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Method #2: Read the Answer Choices Back in the Passage</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Read each answer choice back in the passage. Make sure to still read for context when you plug in each answer choice.</li>
                    <li>Pick the answer choice that best replaces the word in the passage.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <p>Both approaches are equally effective, so which one you use is a matter of preference.</p>

            <h3>Tips for Words in Context Questions</h3>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>Tip #1 – Do not assume the hard vocabulary word is correct.</h4>
                <p>Words in context questions are one place the ACT commonly tests vocabulary knowledge. If you see any word(s) that you do not know, do not assume the hard word is correct. Many students mistakenly think, "Oh, this is the ACT…it must be the hard word since they are testing my vocabulary." Wrong!</p>
                <p>Sometimes, the ACT is testing your vocabulary and the hard word is correct. Other times, the hard word is just a decoy and a simpler word that you know fits correctly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>Tip #2 – Do not pick the answer choice that defines the word.</h4>
                <p>The correct answer is rarely the definition of the word. Most commonly, the word or phrase in the passage is used in an uncommon or unusual way that differs from the definition. However, this is not always the case. Sometimes, the correct answer is the definition of the word. This occurs most commonly for hard vocabulary words.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>Tip #3 – Do the best you can with the words you know.</h4>
                <p>On words in context questions, do the best you can with the words you know. If there is a word you know and it works, pick that word. If you know a word and it does not work, cross it off. If you are stuck between two words that you do not know, bubble in your best guess and move on.</p>
                <p>Do not waste time trying to figure out the definitions of words that you do not know. You either know what a word means, or you don't. No amount of time thinking about what the word means will help you. Move on and use your time answering other questions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="practice-box">
                <h4>Practice Example</h4>
                <p><strong>Context:</strong> "The Panama Canal was officially opened yesterday when a large vessel of the War Department, the Ancon, went through from ocean to ocean. The event was celebrated locally – it was a public holiday along the isthmus – and from New Orleans and other cities interested in the canal and expecting to use it and profit by it, congratulatory telegrams poured in."</p>
                
                <p><strong>Question:</strong> As used in line 7, "interested in" most nearly means:</p>
                <p>A. cautiously intrigued by<br>B. financially invested in<br>C. completely captivated with<br>D. patiently focused on</p>
                
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Looking at the context, the cities are described as "expecting to use it and profit by it," which suggests a financial stake rather than just curiosity. The answer would be B. financially invested in.</p>

                In this chapter, we are focusing on how to best answer the 3 comparing passages questions at the end of the dual text passages. Before we get to the tips, let's review what dual text passages are and how to best approach them.
            </div>

            <p>Each ACT has 1 dual text passage that includes two short passages labelled as Passage A and Passage B. The two passages discuss similar topics and are somehow related. For example, a Literary Narrative passage could have two authors discussing two similar experiences, and a Natural Science passage could have two scientists offering differing opinions on a recent discovery.</p>

            <h3>How to Approach Dual Text Passages</h3>
            <p>When working on dual text passages, we recommend that you read each passage separately. Do not read both passages before starting the questions. Instead, you should use the following approach:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Read Passage A and answer questions for Passage A</li>
                <li>Read Passage B and answer questions for Passage B</li>
                <li>Answer questions about both passages</li>
            </ol>

            <p>When reading the passage, you should still apply whatever method you prefer from the ones we discussed in Chapter 3.</p>

            <p>If you use Working Backwards, use the following approach:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Answer questions for Passage A</li>
                <li>Answer questions for Passage B</li>
                <li>Answer questions about both passages</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Comparing Passages Questions</h3>
            <p>At the end of each dual text passage, there are 3 questions that ask about both passages – we call these comparing passages questions. These questions are always the last 3 questions in the dual text passage.</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <p>Comparing passages questions can look like this:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Which of the following statements best captures the main difference in the purposes of the two passages?</li>
                    <li>Which of the following statements about instruments is most strongly supported by details provided in Passage A and Passage B?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The ACT will have a box telling you that the question asks about both passages, so it is clear when you are looking at comparing passages questions.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>4 Tips for Comparing Passages Questions</h3>
            <p>To answer comparing passages questions correctly, you must use information from both passages. These tips are in addition to all the other methods we have covered so far.</p>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Tip #1 – Read the Answer Choices Right Away</h4>
                <p>Comparing passages questions are generally quite broad, so you should always read the answer choices right away. Once you have read the answer choices and know what the 4 options are, it is much easier to (1) eliminate any answer choices that are clearly incorrect and (2) know what to look for in Passage A and Passage B.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Tip #2 – Work Backwards More Actively with the Answer Choices</h4>
                <p>Comparing passages questions generally have longer answer choices because the answer choice must refer to information in both passages. When you see longer answer choices, work backwards more actively and look for specific details that do not match the passage.</p>
                
                <p>Often, multiple answer choices are partly correct, so it is easier to look for what is incorrect about each answer choice rather than to focus on which answer choice seems to be the most correct.</p>
                
                <div class="example-box">
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> The primary purpose of both passages is to</p>
                    <p>A. resolve a long-standing debate on the evolution of vampire bats.<br>
                    B. celebrate the findings of recent research by Brazilian scientists.<br>
                    C. present two competing theories on the development of echolocation in vampire bats.<br>
                    D. catalog evidence from multiple studies that supports a finding about vampire bats.</p>
                    
                    <p>We need to pick an answer choice that matches both passages. Rather than looking for the correct answer, it is often easier to eliminate answer choices that do not match one passage. For example, if Passage A only presents one theory about the development of echolocation in bats, C is incorrect. Or if Passage B discusses a long-standing debate but does not resolve the debate, A is incorrect.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Tip #3 – Beware of Half-Right Answer Choices</h4>
                <p>For comparing passages questions, the ACT loves writing answer choices that are halfway correct. Part of the answer choice perfectly answers the question; however, there is something wrong with the remaining portion of the answer choice.</p>
                
                <p>Students often pick these incorrect answer choices because they get excited over the part that is correct and do not read the rest of the answer choice carefully enough. As always, we need to be very picky when assessing each answer choice. This is especially true for comparing passages questions.</p>
                
                <div class="example-box">
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Which choice best states the relationship between the two passages?</p>
                    <p>A. Passage A provides an overview of a scientific discovery, while Passage B summarizes the experiments that led to that discovery.<br>
                    B. Passage A summarizes a scientific finding, while Passage B focuses on the potential applications of that finding.<br>
                    C. Passage A presents conflicting points of view on an issue, while Passage B presents evidence supporting a single view on that issue.<br>
                    D. Passage A considers how to best test two hypotheses, while Passage B argues that only one of the hypotheses is valid.</p>
                    
                    <p>Notice how the first half of answer choices A and B are both very similar. These could both accurately describe passage A, but only one can be correct – meaning that one of these answer choices must be half-right. In this situation, it is important to focus on the second half of the answer choices to determine which one is correct.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Tip #4 – Do Not Focus on the Identical Parts of the Answer Choices</h4>
                <p>Many comparing passages questions have portions of multiple answer choices that are identical. When you see identical parts in the answer choices, do not focus on the similarities; instead, focus on the differences.</p>
                
                <p>Students make the mistake of trying to figure out which identical part is more correct, which is often impossible. Instead, you should focus on the differences in the rest of the answer choice, as this is what actually determines which answer choice is the correct one.</p>

            <div class="lesson-intro">
                Now that you have a much better understanding of the ACT Reading Test, you are ready to learn how to work backwards. Working backwards is not recommended for all students, but it is an approach that may help you improve your score.
            </div>

            <p>We do recommend that all students know how to work backwards in case you mess up the pacing on test day and need to work backwards on the final passage, so do not just skip this chapter if working backwards is not your preferred method.</p>

            <h3>Is Working Backwards for Me?</h3>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>What Types of Students Should Work Backwards?</h4>
                <p>In general, we recommend working backwards in 4 situations:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>You cannot finish the passages in time</strong> with any method that involves reading the passage first.</li>
                    <li><strong>You find yourself not recalling what you read</strong> at the end of the passage. If you do not have good recall of what you read, you are probably wasting time reading the passage.</li>
                    <li><strong>You score better working backwards.</strong> For students who are able to finish the passages but are tight on time or barely finish and feel that timing and not comprehension is their biggest issue, working backwards might help you improve your score.</li>
                    <li><strong>You mismanage time and have less than 4 minutes to complete the final passage.</strong> If you have that little time left, reading the passage will use up most of your time. You will most likely be able to answer more questions correctly by going straight to the questions.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>What Types of Students Should Not Work Backwards?</h4>
                <p>We do not recommend working backwards for the following 2 situations:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>You can finish the passages in time</strong> with the Big Read, the Big Read with Notes, or Label then Read. If you are a faster reader and time management is not an issue for you, reading the entire passage will likely help you score higher than working backwards.</li>
                    <li><strong>You are aiming for a score of 32-36.</strong> To score a 32-36, you can usually only miss 0-3 questions. If you never read the passage, you are far more likely to get questions wrong because you did not find the correct evidence.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <h3>How to Work Backwards</h3>
            <p>With working backwards, you go straight to the questions and never read the entire passage. Working backwards successfully requires answering the questions out of order, making quick decisions about which questions to answer, knowing when to give up on a question and move on, and a lot of thinking on the fly.</p>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>General Steps for Working Backwards</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Go straight to the questions before reading the passage</li>
                    <li>Skip any broad passage questions that ask about the entire passage. Save those for last</li>
                    <li>Skip any questions that require reading various parts of the passage</li>
                    <li>Start with line reference questions or questions that reference a specific paragraph</li>
                    <li>Next, look for clear evidence questions with strong primary keywords</li>
                    <li>Next, answer inference questions. Start with inference questions with strong primary keywords</li>
                    <li>Purpose questions are generally best saved for answering later, but it depends on the keywords</li>
                    <li>Answer the broad passage questions or any other questions that you have skipped last</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <h3>Should I Answer This Question Right Away or Save for Later?</h3>
            <p>One essential skill to working backwards is learning how to tell when you should answer a question right away and when you should skip the question and save it for later.</p>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Line Reference Questions</h4>
                <p><strong>Always answer line reference questions right away.</strong> Since these questions tell you where to go, you never need to search for these questions. Read for context and answer the question.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Clear Evidence Questions</h4>
                <p><strong>Answer Right Away:</strong> Clear evidence questions with strong primary keyword(s)</p>
                <p><strong>Save For Later:</strong> Questions without strong primary keywords and questions with answer choices that may be scattered throughout the passage</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Inference Questions</h4>
                <p><strong>Answer Right Away:</strong> Inference questions with strong primary keyword(s) that point to a specific part of the passage</p>
                <p><strong>Save For Later:</strong> Questions without strong primary keywords and questions with answer choices that may be scattered throughout the passage</p>
                <p>In general, you should almost always look at the answer choices for inference questions right away.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>3 Question Types to Always Answer Last</h3>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>1) Chronological Order</h4>
                <p>Save any questions that ask about the chronological order of events in the passage for last. These questions require you to find 4 events in the passage, so they are time consuming and will be faster and easier to answer last. Chronological Order questions are very difficult when working backwards.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>2) Questions That Require Finding Various Details in The Passage</h4>
                <p>Certain questions require that you find various details from the answer choices in multiple parts of the passage. These questions must be saved for last, as finding multiple pieces of evidence in the passage is challenging and time-consuming when working backwards.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>3) Vague Questions That Have No Good Keywords to Skim For</h4>
                <p>For vague questions that have no good keyword(s) to skim for, we need to use the answer choices. For these questions, the answer choices may not make it clear where to look in the passage. We want to save these questions for last to maximize the chance that we read the relevant part of the passage while answering the rest of the questions.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>7 Tips for Working Backwards</h3>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Tip #1: Follow the 30-Second Rule</h4>
                <p>Time management is crucial with working backwards. The biggest mistake students make when working backwards is getting stuck on a question for too long. If you cannot find the keyword(s) that you are looking for after 30 seconds, circle the number, skip the question, and come back to it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Tip #2: Read for More Context</h4>
                <p>The 2-sentence rule is a good start, but you may need to read more than that to understand the part of the passage you are in. Since you are not taking time to read the entire passage, you have more time to read for context as you answer the questions. For some questions, you may need to read the entire paragraph. Do it!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Tip #3: The Answer Choices Are Your Friends</h4>
                <p>When working backwards, you should rely on the answer choices more than with any of our other methods. In general, you should read most answer choices quickly when working backwards. The information in the answer choices can help you identify where to go in the passage, find other keyword(s) to potentially search for, and identify the Waldo more quickly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Tip #4: Know When to Give Up and Move On</h4>
                <p>As you practice, try to find your give-up point. You should have a voice in your head that goes, "Ok, I cannot find this one. It is time to move on" and you need to listen to that voice on test day! This will help you improve your time management and make sure that you stay on pace to finish all 4 passages.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Tip #5: Work Backwards (Especially When You Can't Find Waldo)</h4>
                <p>It is likely that you will not be able to find the Waldo every time working backwards, and that is okay. For any question where you cannot find the Waldo, read the answer choices like a lawyer and eliminate incorrect answer choices. Remember, if you know that 3 answers are incorrect, you have found the correct answer!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Tip #6: Educated Guesses Are Better Than Not Finishing</h4>
                <p>The goal with working backwards is to finish all 36 questions. You are most likely not going to be 100% confident on all your answer choices; that is expected with working backwards. To work backwards properly, you will need to answer some questions when you are 80% sure or even 50% sure that you have found the right answer.</p>
                <p>It is better to finish all 36 questions and make some educated guesses along the way than to run out of time and blindly guess on questions at the end.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Tip #7: Working Backwards Takes Practice</h4>
                <p>Do not expect working backwards to feel easy the first time (or even 5 times) you try it. For most students, working backwards feels like a struggle at first. It takes lots of practice to master all the skills we have just discussed.</p>
                <p>After each practice passage, try to ask yourself the following questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How was my pacing?</li>
                    <li>Did I miss a keyword that could have helped me find the Waldo more quickly or easily?</li>
                    <li>Did I answer the questions in the best order possible?</li>
                    <li>Did I read for enough context?</li>
                    <li>Did I get stuck on a question for too long?</li>
                    <li>Could I have used the answer choices better?</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>7 Tips to Maximize Your Reading Score</h3>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Tip #1 – Keep it Moving</h4>
                <p>Time management is critical for success on the Reading Test. Remember, you have 10 minutes per passage for normal time and 15 minutes per passage for extended time, and you want to make sure that you finish all 4 passages.</p>
                
                <p>In general, you should never spend more than 1 minute on any single question (1.5 minutes for extended time). At first, it may be hard to manage time and know when to move on, but you will get a better sense of time management as you complete practice ACTs.</p>
                
                <p>This is especially true on the first 4-6 questions of each passage, where you need to follow the 30-second rule! If you cannot find the correct part of the passage quickly, circle the question number and move on. You may come across the evidence as you answer questions in the rest of the passage.</p>
                
                <p>We know it feels weird moving on without being confident in your answer choice but knowing when to move on will increase your score. You will be able to answer more questions and avoid guessing as time is running out.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Tip #2 – Circle Guesses; Box Non-Confident Answers</h4>
                <p>Whenever you guess on a question, <strong>circle the question number</strong> on your test. If you finish with time left, go back to the circled questions you guessed on and spend more time looking for the Waldo. The question may also seem easier when you come back to it a second time.</p>
                
                <p>If you are not confident in your answer, <strong>box the question number</strong> on your test. If you have time left after going back to the circled questions you guessed on, you can look over these boxed questions again. Only change your answer if you have a very good reason! You are usually correct on your first attempt.</p>
                
                <p>However, if you realize you misread the question, did not notice a detail in the passage, or notice something that makes the answer choice you selected incorrect, change your answer.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Tip #3 – Never Worry About Patterns in the Answer Choices</h4>
                <p>"I bubbled in A and F for the last 4 questions. There is no way this one can be A again, right??" WRONG!</p>
                
                <p>When answering a question, only focus on that question. Never let any pattern in the answer choices affect which answer choice you pick. Sometimes, the same spot on the scantron sheet is correct 4 or even 5 times in a row on the ACT. It is also possible that you answered one of the previous questions incorrectly, and there are not supposed to be 4 or 5 in a row.</p>
                
                <p>There is no way for you to know on test day, so just focus on selecting what you think is correct for each question.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Tip #4 – Boring is Better</h4>
                <p>Boring answer choices are usually better on the ACT. If you are ever between two answer choices, always pick the more boring answer choice! The more specific an answer choice is, the more likely something in that answer choice is incorrect. Remember, an answer choice must be 100% correct to be correct.</p>
                
                <p>The challenge is that we do not like to pick boring answer choices, especially on challenging questions. An answer choice with more details is much easier to come up with a story as to why the answer could be correct, which makes you feel better bubbling it in.</p>
                
                <p>Your job is to pick the answer choice that is supported by the passage, not the one that feels best to you. So again, when you are between two answer choices, pick the boring one with fewer details.</p>

                <h4>Tip #5 – Beware of Keyword Matching</h4>
                <p>Anytime you see words in an answer choice that directly match words from the passage, proceed with caution. Make sure the entire answer choice is correct. Matching keywords may be in the correct answer choice, but they can also be in incorrect answer choices that are half-truths, where part of the answer choice perfectly matches the passage but another part is incorrect.</p>
                
                <p>Students often mistakenly pick these incorrect answer choices because the keywords match. Never just match keywords; always make sure the answer choice you select is 100% correct.</p>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Tip #6 – Do Not Over-Annotate</h4>
                <p>Some students annotate a lot. Others make no annotations at all. There is no right or wrong way to annotate, so you need to find what works best for you. What is most important is to make sure that annotating is helping you better understand the passage and work through the questions more efficiently.</p>
                
                <p>If you are underlining 50% of the passage, those are not helpful annotations. If you are writing down notes after each paragraph but never use those notes, you are wasting time.</p>
                
                <p>Proper annotations should help you maintain focus as you read, increase your comprehension of what you read, and know where in the passage to go when working through the questions. How much you annotate and what types of annotations you use varies from student to student. On practice ACTs, try different methods for annotation and find what works best for you.</p>

                <h4>Tip #7 – Make the Most of Practice ACTs</h4>
                <p>Practice ACTs are the best way to improve on the Reading Test…if you are using and reviewing them properly. Here are some tips for how to make the most of your practice ACTs:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Always time practice ACTs strictly.</strong> Never give yourself extra time to finish the section and see how you would have scored. It will give you false confidence for how much you are improving.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Review your mistakes thoroughly.</strong> Whenever you answer a question incorrectly, go back to the passage and find the evidence for the correct answer. Make sure you identify why your answer choice was incorrect. It is critical to learn from every single mistake you make to continuously improve.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Be obsessive about improving.</strong> Students who improve the most on the Reading Test are the ones who are most obsessive about learning from their mistakes. After each question, try to figure out why you missed the question. Did you not read the question carefully enough? Were you answering your own question and not exactly what the ACT was asking you? Did you not recognize the type of question? Once you figure out why you made the mistake, think about how you can avoid the mistake in the future.</li>

                Now that you have learned everything you need to know about the ACT Reading Test, let's put it all together in full practice passages. The following 8 practice passages test you on all the skills and question types we have covered in this course.
            </div>

            <h3>Tips for Practice Passages</h3>
            <p>As you work through these passages, keep these few tips in mind:</p>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>1. Complete these passages 1 at a time and review right after each passage.</h4>
                <p>Right after you complete the passage, you will remember exactly what you were thinking as you answered each question. As you review your work, you can identify exactly what you did correctly, where you made any mistakes in your thinking, and how you can improve on the next passage.</p>
                <p>If you complete a bunch of passages in a row or review much later, you will not learn as effectively.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>2. Try different approaches to find the one that works for you.</h4>
                <p>We discussed a variety of approaches in Chapter 3. If you are not sure what approach is best for you, try different approaches on different passages. Once you find your favorite approach, stick with that approach for the rest of your practice passages and practice ACTs to perfect that approach.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>3. Do not worry about strictly timing the first 4 practice passages.</h4>
                <p>You have 10 minutes per passage (15 minutes with extended time), but you can take more time on these passages as you work on applying all the skills we have learned. Your goal on these passages is to try your best to answer all the questions correctly. Focus on applying what you have learned. If you need to take a bit more time to do so at first, that is fine!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>4. Set a timer for the last 4 practice passages and work on your pacing skills.</h4>
                <p>Try to apply the pacing skills that we discussed in Chapter 4 and the time management tips from Chapter 4. Set a timer according to the times below:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Regular Time</strong> = 10 minutes</li>
                    <li><strong>Extended Time</strong> = 15 minutes</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Do your best to complete the passage in time. If you do not finish in time, complete the rest of the questions for practice and think about how you could have better managed your time. Make notes of what you can do to improve on the next passage.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>5. Learn from your mistakes.</h4>
                <p>Review any topic(s) that you need to before going to the next practice passage. Students who improve the most are the ones who are the most obsessive about learning from their mistakes. After each passage, try to identify why you missed the questions that you answered incorrectly.</p>
                
                <p>If there is any topic(s) from the course that you need to review, go back and review before working on the next practice passage. For example, if you notice that you are struggling on spotting the different question types, go back to Chapter 5.</p>
                
                <p>This course has covered tons of information in a short period of time, so a quick review can be effective to help you continue to improve.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>6. Be patient!</h4>
                <p>ACT Reading is a very difficult section for some students, and it is easy to get discouraged if you are missing a lot of questions. Do your best and use the explanations to learn how to improve your skills. You will not immediately start answering all questions correctly. It is a journey to get to the score you want.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Your goal is to get a little bit better with each passage.</strong></p>
            </div>
