            <h3>What is on each ACT Science Test?</h3>
            <p>The ACT Science Test always consists of:</p>
            
            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>5 Charts and Graphs Passages</h4>
                <p>Test your ability to read charts and graphs and interpret information given in tables, diagrams, and figures. For certain passages, you will also be asked questions about the experimental design. This is the most common type of passage on the ACT.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>1 Conflicting Viewpoints Passage</h4>
                <p>Asks you to understand, analyze, and compare different hypotheses, opinions, or conclusions. This passage has much more text and sometimes has no charts or graphs at all. The headings say "Student 1, Student 2" or "Scientist 1, Scientist 2," so these passages are easy to spot.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Six Types of Questions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Detail:</strong> Ask you to locate a specific piece of data from graphs, charts, tables, or diagrams</li>
                <li><strong>Pattern:</strong> Ask you to spot a trend on a graph, table, or chart (increase, decreasing, etc.)</li>
                <li><strong>Inference:</strong> Ask you to make a conclusion based on the data provided</li>
                <li><strong>Method:</strong> Test your understanding of experimental setup and scientific methods</li>
                <li><strong>Scientific Knowledge:</strong> Require you to use some outside scientific knowledge (least common)</li>
                <li><strong>Compare/Contrast:</strong> Only in conflicting viewpoints passages, ask you to consider various aspects of opposing arguments</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>Important Note</h4>
                <p>A more accurate name for this test would be "The Analyzing Charts and Graphs on Random Topics Quickly Test." You can get a great score even if you don't love science class!</p>

                Science passages often look intimidating due to the amount of information and random topics. Here's how to tackle them effectively.
            </div>
            
            <h3>Charts & Graphs Strategies</h3>
            <p>For the five charts and graphs passages:</p>
            
            <div class="rules-box">
                <h4>30-Second Rule</h4>
                <p>Spend around 30 seconds before starting on the questions. Focus on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Labels of the axes</li>
                    <li>What is being measured in each chart</li>
                    <li>Where information is located</li>
                    <li>Read only the first sentence of the passage and experiments</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>Key Strategy</h4>
                <p>Most of the information in charts and graphs passages is extra and unnecessary. Don't spend time trying to read and understand the entire passageâ€”it's not necessary and you will run out of time!</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Question Difficulty Progression</h3>
            <p>Within each passage, questions go from easy to hard. The first 2-3 questions are generally straightforward, often just asking you to spot a trend or find a data point. Later questions can get more difficult.</p>
            
            <h3>Conflicting Viewpoints Strategy</h3>
            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Different Approach Required</h4>
                <p>Rather than skimming, you must treat this more like a reading passage:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Read and annotate the entire passage</li>
                    <li>Underline key differences between viewpoints</li>
                    <li>Most students save this passage for last as it's most time-consuming</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Time Management Tips</h3>
            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>5-6 Minutes Per Passage</h4>
                <p>If you spend more than 30 seconds on a problem, bubble in your best guess, circle the question, and move on. You can always come back if you have time.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-takeaway">
                <h4>Remember</h4>
                <p>Trust the questions! If a question begins with "Based on Figure 2," the answer is in Figure 2. The ACT is not trying to trick you.</p>

            <h3>4 Places to Look in a Science Passage</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>1. Figures and Tables</h4>
                <p>The most common place for answers. The question will tell you which Figure or Table to look at.</p>
                <p><strong>When to go here:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The question directs you by saying "Figure 1," "Table 1," etc.</li>
                    <li>The answers are all numbers with units</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>2. Experimental Text</h4>
                <p>Text right above the Figures and Tables that explains what they show and gives other relevant information.</p>
                <p><strong>When to go here:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Questions about experimental setup or differences between experiments</li>
                    <li>Questions about variables not shown in Figures or Tables</li>
                    <li>Answer choices have units not in the Figures or Tables</li>

            </div>
            
            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>3. Introductory Text</h4>
                <p>Text at the beginning of the passage, mainly for definitions of unfamiliar terms.</p>
                <p><strong>When to go here:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Terms or scientific words appear in the question that you need to know</li>
                    <li>If you've looked at Experimental Text and didn't find what you need</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>4. Not in the Passage</h4>
                <p>Basic science knowledge & experimental thinking questions that require your own knowledge.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>Pro Tip</h4>
                <p>Always read both the question AND the answer choices. Both will provide big clues that direct you where to look in the passage.</p>

                Many of the easiest questions on the ACT Science Test will simply ask you to go to the Figures and Tables and find a specific data point.
            </div>
            
            <h3>How to Spot These Questions</h3>
            
            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>Two Clear Indicators</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Questions tell you which chart to look at:</strong> "According to Figure 2..." "Based on Table 1..." "The data in Figure 1 show..."</li>
                    <li><strong>All answer choices are numbers with units:</strong> Like 5 cm, 8 cm, 12 cm, 18 cm</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            
            <h3>How to Answer Successfully</h3>
            <p>To answer these questions successfully, you must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Read the question carefully to know exactly what you're looking for</li>
                <li>Pay special attention to the axes and legends</li>
                <li>Make sure you find the exact data point the question asks for</li>
                <li>Pay attention to units in answer choices to ensure you're looking at the correct axis or data</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Example Question</h4>
                <p><strong>Based on Figure 3, the average depth of the tomato plant roots at 17 days was:</strong></p>
                <p>A. 5 cm<br>
                B. 8 cm<br>
                C. 12 cm<br>
                D. 18 cm</p>
                
                <p>If the question says "Based on Figure 1," go to Figure 1! The ACT is not trying to trick you; it is telling you where the answer is.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="rules-box">
                <h4>Remember the Units</h4>
                <p>The units in the answer choices will help you make sure you are looking at the correct axis of a graph or the correct data in a table.</p>

            <div class="lesson-intro">
                Trends questions ask you to spot patterns in data. These can range from very easy questions that simply ask you to track how numbers change across a graph to difficult questions that ask you to identify non-obvious trends within tables.
            </div>
            
            <h3>How to Spot Trends Questions</h3>
            
            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>Look at the Answer Choices</h4>
                <p>The easiest way to spot a trends question is to use the answer choices. If you see answer choices that say "increases only" or "remains constant," you're dealing with a trends question.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> As the temperature decreases, the angle of the rose bush stems:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A. Increased only</li>
                    <li>B. Increased then decreased</li>
                    <li>C. Decreased only</li>
                    <li>D. Remained constant</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>How to Answer Successfully</h3>
            <p>When you are asked to spot trends:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Focus on identifying the pattern in the data, not specific numbers</li>
                <li>Read the questions carefully to make sure you're looking at the correct data</li>
                <li>For table questions, identify which trials to compare by finding where only one variable changes</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Trends in Tables</h3>
            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>More Challenging</h4>
                <p>More difficult trends questions often appear in passages with large data tables. The challenge is to identify which parts of the table to look at. You need to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Read the question carefully</li>
                    <li>Identify which variable(s) should be changing and which should remain constant</li>
                    <li>Find trials that show the trend you're being asked about</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="rules-box">
                <h4>Key Rule for Tables</h4>
                <p>When trying to identify trends in tables, look at groups of trials where only one independent variable is being changed. This way you can spot the trend based on how the independent variable affects a dependent variable.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-takeaway">
                <h4>Remember</h4>
                <p>Focus on the pattern, not the specific numbers. The ACT wants to see if you can identify how variables relate to each other.</p>

                <h4>Answer Choices Give Them Away</h4>
                <p>These questions are easy to spot because of their distinctive answer format:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A) Less than 100m</li>
                    <li>B) Between 100m and 150m</li>
                    <li>C) Between 150m and 250m</li>
                    <li>D) Greater than 250m</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Every time you see answer choices like this, it's an approximation question asking about a value not actually shown in the Figures or Tables.</p>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Bracketing Questions</h4>
                <p>You'll be asked to find a data point that is between two given data points. Simply consider what data points the value fits between, then spot the correct answer.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Extending Questions</h4>
                <p>You'll be asked about a data point outside of the graph. Simply take your pencil and extend the trend line outside of the graph. The answer should be easy to spot after that.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Approximation in Tables</h3>
            <div class="rules-box">
                <h4>Strategy for Tables</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>For easier questions, follow trends across the entire table</li>
                    <li>For more difficult questions, identify which specific trials will help you find the trends</li>
                    <li>Pay careful attention to other variablesâ€”those not part of the question should remain constant</li>

                <h4>When Figures Aren't Enough</h4>
                <p>On some multiple figures questions, you may need additional information not located in the Figures or Tables. If the question asks about information not in the Figures or Tables, look in the text above that describes the setup of the experiment.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a question asks "How many Trials were run without electricity?" and there's no electricity data in the charts, go to the experimental description text.</p>

            <h3>When to Use the Text</h3>
            <p>Most often, these questions will ask you about:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Certain units or values for a specific term not included in the Figures or Tables</li>
                <li>Experimental procedures or setup details</li>
                <li>Definitions of terms used in the experiment</li>
                <li>Conditions or variables that are controlled but not shown in the data</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Simple Strategy</h4>
                <p>If this happens, just go to the text above the Figures or Tables and find the information there. The experimental text will explain what the Table or Figure is showing and provide other relevant details.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Experimental Conditions</h4>
                <p>Questions might ask about conditions like temperature, pressure, or other controlled variables that aren't graphed but are mentioned in the experimental description.</p>

                    <li>Try the figures first</li>
                    <li>If the information isn't there, go to the experimental text</li>

            <h3>How to Approach 2-Part Questions</h3>
            
            <div class="rules-box">
                <h4>Recommended Strategy</h4>
                <p>Always break the answers into two parts and work to answer one part at a time. We recommend:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Start with the second part (the explanation)</strong> - usually based on Figures/Tables or basic scientific knowledge</li>
                    <li><strong>Answer the first part (the claim) last</strong> - use the explanation to eliminate incorrect answers</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Common Answer Pattern</h3>
            
            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>Typical Structure</h4>
                <p>Most 2-part questions follow this pattern:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>First part (claim):</strong> A and B match, C and D match</li>
                    <li><strong>Second part (explanation):</strong> A and C match, B and D match</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A. Yes, because the boiling point of water is below 100Â°C</li>
                    <li>B. Yes, because the boiling point of water is above 100Â°C</li>
                    <li>C. No, because the boiling point of water is below 100Â°C</li>
                    <li>D. No, because the boiling point of water is above 100Â°C</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Strategy Benefits</h3>
            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Why Start with the Explanation</h4>
                <p>The second part of the answer is usually:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Based on the Figures and Tables (easier to verify)</li>
                    <li>Based on basic scientific knowledge</li>
                    <li>Much easier to validate than the first part</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Even if you can't tell exactly which claim is correct, you should be able to eliminate 2 answers as incorrect and guess between just 2 answers.</p>

            <h3>Important Warning</h3>
            <div class="correction-box">
                <h4>Not All Questions Follow the Pattern</h4>
                <p>Always read the answers carefully! Some questions don't follow the standard pattern:</p>
                
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Does the hummingbird or sparrow show greater increase in flight distance?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A. The hummingbird, because D increased by 0.8 miles</li>
                    <li>B. The hummingbird, because D increased by 1.6 miles</li>
                    <li>C. The sparrow, because D increased by 1.2 miles</li>
                    <li>D. The sparrow, because D increased by 2.0 miles</li>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Why Remove Moisture?</h4>
                <p>Scientists often dry samples to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Get accurate mass measurements of the actual substance (not including water weight)</li>
                    <li>Prevent water from interfering with chemical reactions</li>
                    <li>Ensure consistent starting conditions</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Temperature Effects</h4>
                <p>Understanding freezing and boiling points helps predict:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Whether water will remain liquid, freeze, or evaporate</li>
                    <li>How much liquid water will be collected in experiments</li>
                    <li>Whether phase changes will occur during experiments</li>

                <h4>Most Questions Don't Require Charts</h4>
                <p>The majority of water questions focus on experimental steps that relate to water. Usually, these questions will not require you to look at a chart or graphâ€”they test your basic understanding of water's properties.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="practice-box">
                <h4>Think Logically</h4>
                <p>When you see water-related questions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Consider the temperature conditions</li>
                    <li>Think about what state water would be in</li>
                    <li>Consider why scientists might want to remove or control water</li>
                    <li>Use the key temperatures (0Â°C and 100Â°C) as reference points</li>

                <h4>Key Strategy</h4>
                <p>These questions test basic scientific thinking about water's properties. Remember the key temperatures and phase changes, and think about why controlling water content might be important in experiments.</p>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>Look for "Most Likely"</h4>
                <p>When you see the term "most likely" in the question, the answer is usually not going to be in the passage; instead, you will need to rely on your own outside science knowledge and logical thinking.</p>

            <h3>Common Experimental Setup Questions</h3>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Controlling Variables</h4>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> "The reason that all of the plants in the experiment were grown in the same acre plot was most likely:"</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A. To be exposed to different environments</li>
                    <li>B. To receive the same amount of rain âœ“</li>
                    <li>C. To increase cross pollination</li>
                    <li>D. To increase their growth rates</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Logic:</strong> Same location = same environmental conditions</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Environmental Control</h4>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> "What is the most likely reason the terrariums were placed outside?"</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A. To receive the same soil quality</li>
                    <li>B. To receive the same amount of rain</li>
                    <li>C. To be the same temperature âœ“</li>
                    <li>D. To receive the same nutrients</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Logic:</strong> Outside placement ensures all samples experience the same temperature conditions</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Scientific Thinking Principles</h3>
            
            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Control Variables</h4>
                <p>Scientists try to keep everything the same except for the variable they're testing. Look for setups that ensure:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Same environmental conditions (temperature, light, humidity)</li>
                    <li>Same starting materials or amounts</li>
                    <li>Same time periods for observation</li>
                    <li>Same measurement techniques</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Eliminate Bias</h4>
                <p>Experimental setups often aim to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Prevent external factors from affecting results</li>
                    <li>Ensure fair comparison between different groups</li>
                    <li>Reduce measurement errors</li>
                    <li>Make results repeatable</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>How to Approach These Questions</h3>
            
            <div class="rules-box">
                <h4>Think Like a Scientist</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Identify what's being tested:</strong> What variable is the experiment trying to measure?</li>
                    <li><strong>Consider what needs to be controlled:</strong> What other factors might affect the results?</li>
                    <li><strong>Look for the setup that controls those factors:</strong> Which answer choice best ensures a fair test?</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            
            <div class="practice-box">
                <h4>Common Setup Purposes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Same location:</strong> Controls temperature, weather, soil conditions</li>
                    <li><strong>Same time period:</strong> Controls seasonal effects, ensures fair comparison</li>
                    <li><strong>Multiple trials:</strong> Increases reliability of results</li>
                    <li><strong>Control groups:</strong> Provides baseline for comparison</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="correction-box">
                <h4>Avoid Overthinking</h4>
                <p>These questions test basic scientific reasoning, not complex theories. Go with the answer that makes the most logical sense for ensuring a fair, controlled experiment.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-takeaway">
                <h4>Core Principle</h4>
                <p>Good experimental design controls for outside variables while testing only the variable of interest. The "most likely" reason for any setup is usually to make the experiment more controlled and reliable.</p>
